Preprocessing

This is the initial step in data handling where raw data is cleaned and transformed to make it suitable for analysis. It includes tasks like:

Data Cleaning: Removing errors, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Normalization/Standardization: Adjusting values to a common scale.
Encoding: Converting categorical data into numerical format.
Missing Value Treatment: Handling gaps in data through imputation or removal.


Analysis

This phase involves applying statistical and computational methods to extract insights from the preprocessed data. Key aspects include:

Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing data through measures like mean, median, and standard deviation.
Inferential Statistics: Drawing conclusions and making predictions based on data samples.
Modeling: Using algorithms (e.g., regression, classification) to identify patterns and relationships.


Graphical Representation

This step involves visualizing data and analysis results to enhance understanding and communication. Common techniques include:

Charts and Graphs: Bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots to illustrate trends and comparisons.
Heatmaps: Representing data intensity or correlations visually.
Dashboards: Combining multiple visualizations for an interactive data exploration experience.
Together, these steps facilitate effective data-driven decision-making and insights generation.
